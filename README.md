# COMPARATIVE-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS
Analyzing the stock returns of major companies over a period of time offers valuable insights 
into market trends, sector dynamics, and macroeconomic impacts. This project examines the 
financial data of ten prominent Indian companies from 2019 to 2024, providing a comprehensive 
overview of diverse sectors including technology, finance, consumer goods, telecommunications, 
industrials, and automotive. The selected companies—Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Tata 
Consultancy Services, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel, Larsen & Toubro, 
Asian Paints, and Maruti Suzuki—are market leaders in their respective fields, making them 
ideal representatives for understanding the broader economic landscape.
To analyze the stock returns of these companies, we will employ the Fama-French model to 
understand the three factors influencing returns: market risk, size, and value effects. 
Additionally, the project will involve calculating various financial ratios and performance 
metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, and Jensen's alpha to evaluate the risk-adjusted 
returns of these companies.
Moreover, we will assess the portfolio returns by constructing conservative, balanced, and 
aggressive portfolios based on the historical data of these companies. This multifaceted approach 
aims to gain actionable insights for investment strategies and predictive financial modeling, 
providing a robust framework for making informed financial decisions
